This was an experimental study with external participants. We created a method to improve the classic machine-learning algorithm "TAMER"[1], and make TAMER models more accessible to people who aren’t ML experts, without losing any of TAMER’s benefits.

See setup_instructions.txt to add the experiment to your device, and see and run_instructions.txt if you want to experience the experiment.
